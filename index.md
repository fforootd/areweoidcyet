## What?

This site is being used to track the progress of [Matrix](https://matrix.org) migrating to OIDC for authentication. You can join the discussion at [#matrix-auth:matrix.org](https://matrix.to/#/#matrix-auth:matrix.org).

We have also set up the [Matrix OIDC Playground](https://github.com/vector-im/oidc-playground) which contains Homeservers, OIDC Providers and Clients for you to try out.

<a id="why"></a>

## Why?

For detailed background on the rationale to this project please see [MSC3861](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3861).

***TL;DR** Currently Matrix uses a custom authentication protocol baked in to the Matrix spec. This poses a number of drawbacks. To overcome these drawbacks we are working to migrate to use OIDC instead.*

<a id="when"></a>

## When?

Good question. There are a number of moving parts to this project which are outlined below.

Outstanding key decision points:

- How will device IDs allocated? Currently these are generated by the Homeserver and tied to an access token
- How will UIA protected endpoints work?
- How does guest access work?

### Clients

[MSC3824](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3824) proposes four types of Matrix client:

1. **OIDC native client** - This is a client that fully uses OIDC when talking to an OIDC enabled homeserver.
1. **OIDC aware client** - This is a client that is aware of OIDC but will still use existing auth types (e.g. `m.login.sso`) to auth with an OIDC enabled homeserver.
1. **Legacy client with SSO support** - This is a client that is not aware of OIDC but does support `m.login.sso` flow. e.g. Element Web, iOS, Android, Fluffy, Nheko, Cinny
1. **Legacy client without SSO support** - This is a client that is not aware of OIDC at all and nor does it support `m.login.sso` flow. Typically auth is done via `m.login.password` only. e.g. Fractal

#### OIDC Aware clients

These are the requirements for a client to be OIDC-aware from [MSC3824](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/blob/hughns/sso-redirect-action/proposals/3824-oidc-aware-clients.md#definition-of-oidc-aware):

## FAQs

TODO

#### How will this work with E2EE?

#### Does this mean I can't combine E2EE & account password?

#### How does this work with QR code login?

#### What do I do for my nintendo 3DS which doesn't have a web browser?

#### Will I lose my old-style login/password?

#### Are we going to migrate existing accounts over?

#### Are you really rebuilding all of Keycloak in matrix-auth-service?!

#### How do I do social login with this?

#### Will clients need to support both old-style and new-style auth?

#### How do I migrate from my existing SSO to new-style OIDC?

#### Does this mean that the login page/screen's branding isn't going to match the branding of my app any more?
