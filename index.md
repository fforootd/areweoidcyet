<a id="what"></a>## What?

This site is being used to track the progress of [Matrix](https://matrix.org) migrating to OIDC for authentication. You can join the discussion at [#matrix-auth:matrix.org](https://matrix.to/#/#matrix-auth:matrix.org).

We have also set up the [Matrix OIDC Playground](https://github.com/vector-im/oidc-playground) which contains Homeservers, OIDC Providers and Clients for you to try out.

<a id="why"></a>## Why?

For detailed background on the rationale to this project please see [MSC3861](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3861).

***TL;DR** Currently Matrix uses a custom authentication protocol baked in to the Matrix spec. This poses a number of drawbacks. To overcome these drawbacks we are working to migrate to use OIDC instead.*

<a id="when"></a>## When?

Good question. There are a number of moving parts to this project which are outlined below.

### Matrix Spec

Outstanding key decision points:

- How will device IDs allocated? Currently these are generated by the Homeserver and tied to an access token
- How will UIA protected endpoints work?
- How does guest access work?

### Homeservers

TODO: Homeserver requirements + status.

### Clients

TODO: Client requirements + status.

### OIDC Providers
